## TransBorder Freight Data Analysis Report

### Introduction
 
 #### Overview
Transportation systems are the backbone of modern economies, facilitating the movement of goods, services, and people across cities, states, and nations. They are vital for commerce, tourism, and daily living, directly impacting economic productivity and societal well-being. However, as transportation networks grow in complexity, they face numerous challenges, including safety concerns, inefficiencies, and sustainability issues.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) serves as a vital resource in addressing these challenges by providing comprehensive and reliable data on multiple dimensions of transportation systems. This includes passenger travel, freight movement, safety incidents, infrastructure capacity, and environmental impacts. Such data enables policymakers, transportation agencies, and businesses to make informed decisions to enhance transportation systems for the public good.

#### Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze transborder freight data from the BTS to uncover insights related to the efficiency, safety, and environmental impacts of freight transportation across various modes (road, rail, air, and water). Key objectives include:

- Uncover Freight Movement Patterns: Analyze the movement of freight across different transportation modes, identifying trends in volume, routing, and modes of transportation used across regions and time periods.

- Identify Operational Inefficiencies: Investigate areas where transportation systems may experience inefficiencies, such as congestion points, delays, or underutilized infrastructure, and propose methods to optimize resource use and improve throughput.

- Analyze Environmental Impact: Assess the environmental impact of freight transportation by studying data on emissions, fuel usage, and sustainability metrics across different modes of transportation, and recommend strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of the sector.

- Safety and Risk Assessment: Identify transportation safety incidents related to freight, evaluate their causes and consequences, and suggest recommendations for improving safety protocols.

- Economic Disruptions: Analyze how economic disruptions (e.g., trade patterns, policy changes, or global events) impact freight movements and overall transportation efficiency.

- Provide Data-Driven Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to enhance the performance, sustainability, and safety of the transportation systems that handle cross-border freight.

#### Methodological Framework
The analysis will be conducted using the CRISP-DM methodology (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), ensuring a structured, iterative approach that drives valuable business insights and leads to practical recommendations. Data wrangling, visualization, and thorough documentation will be integral to the process to ensure the insights are communicated effectively to stakeholders.

### Methodology
#### Utilizing the CRISP-DM Framework
The CRISP-DM methodology provides a structured approach to data mining projects and consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. For this analysis, we will focus primarily on the first three phases.

### Business Understanding
This phase involves defining the business objectives and translating them into data mining goals. The analytical questions guiding this project are as follows:

- How did freight movement patterns shift from 2020 to 2024?
- What are the monthly patterns of freight movement?
- Which modes are more efficient in terms of value per weight?
- What are the top commodities by freight value and weight?
- Which regions contribute most to freight value and weight?
- How does the freight value vary across U.S. states, Mexican states, and Canadian provinces when analyzed by different trade types?
- What are the most common freight route descriptions used in cross-border transportation with Canada and Mexico from 2020 to 2024?

These questions aim to uncover insights that can help improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability in freight transportation.

### Data Understanding
#### Dataset Overview
The datasets provided by BTS cover freight data from 2020 to 2024, including various metrics such as:

- Transport Modes: Different modes of transportation (road, rail, air, water).
- Freight Volume and Weight: Total volume and weight of freight transported.
- Costs: Freight charges associated with the movement of goods.
- Geographic Data: Origin and destination states or provinces.

#### Data Loading and Inspection
The first step in data understanding is to load and inspect the datasets to become familiar with their structure and contents:

#### Data Inspection
After loading the data, itâ€™s important to inspect it for:

- Missing Values: Determine which columns have missing data and the extent of the missingness.
- Data Types: Check data types to ensure they are appropriate for analysis (e.g., numeric, categorical).

### Data Preparation
Data preparation involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. Key steps include:

#### Handling Missing Values
To ensure data integrity, missing values will be replaced with appropriate placeholders:

#### Data Type Conversion
Certain columns may need to be converted to the correct data types, such as converting numerical columns from strings to integers.

#### Deriving New Variables
New variables, such as origin region and route descriptions, will be created to enhance analysis.
